##Usage##

1. Clone the repo onto the demo machine:

        git clone git@github.com:Brunello/myngle-demo.git // Puts the demo site into new /myngle-demo directory

  Or choose your own directory name:

        mkdir mydir
        cd mydir
        git clone git@github.com:Brunello/myngle-demo.git .

2. Access `index.html` from your browser. Demo site does not require MySQL
   Apache or PHP. But it does require that the host computer have internet
   access to retrive the CDN hosted jQuery.

##Known Issues##

* Active state is off-by-one when navigating to previous rooms from the
  navigation menu.

* ~~Final slide should be fixed at bottom (should not be able to scroll past).~~
